For my 15112 Term Project, I made a 3-D aquarium simulator.
I used Panda3D and Blender, so those modules and their respective libraries should be installed.
*Note: Blender does not need to be installed to have the program
run.

To download either of these modules, go to their respective websites:
panda3d.com
blender.org

In this program, I used Blender to make 3D models of the aquarium, tank decorations, and fish. I utilized Panda3D to animate the models frame-by-frame and have them move within bounds and in different behaviors. For example, I could make a fish with aggressive behavior that chased other fish. I also utilized Panda3D's extensive GUI library and camera effects for this project.

Walking through the program, there is first a 3-d tank displayed with options to move the camera and view the program from different viewpoints. A user can add a fish, customize it with name, species, and behavior. Then the user runs the program and sees the fish animate.

After adding the first fish, there are options to add more fish, feed the fish, look from fish view, and create a user fish.

Add more fish adds more fish.

Feed fish enters a mode where you can “grab food” and use the mouse to place the fish flakes down and watch the fish swim to chase it.

Fish view mode opens a split screen in the bottom left corner and puts a camera directly behind a fish of your choosing. This lets the user view the aquarium from the fish’s view.

User fish lets the user create a fish that they will control. Once run, the user can input the up/down/left/right arrow keys to rotate and move the fish in the direction of their choosing.
