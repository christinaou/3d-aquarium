For my 15112 Term Project, I made a 3-D aquarium simulator.
I used Panda3D and Blender, so those modules and their respective libraries should be installed.
*Note: Blender does not need to be installed to have the program
run.

To download either of these modules, go to their respective websites:
panda3d.com
blender.org

In this program, I used Blender to make 3D models of the aquarium, tank decorations, and fish. I utilized Panda3D to animate the models frame-by-frame and have them move in different behaviors. For example, I could make a fish with aggressive behavior that chased other fish. I also utilized Panda3D's extensive GUI library and camera effects for this project.
